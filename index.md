Hi! My name is Yunrui Lu. I'm a Bioengineering PhD student at Caltech. I'm interested in developing ML and statistical methods, using spatial transcriptomics, single cell and multiomics to explore tumor heterogeneity and cell cell communication in tumor immune microenvironment.

Previously, I worked at Cedars Sinai and Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center as research associate. I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2022 with Master degree in Quantitative Biomedical Science, and from Xiamen University, China in 2021 with Bachelor degrees in German Language and Literature and Mathematical Economics.

I'm always happy to connect and collaborate with researchers who are interested in computational biology, deep learning, spatial transcriptomics, single cell and digital pathology. I have mentored master students and undergrads. Feel free to reach out and would love to chat about potential opportunities.

## Out of lab
I spend a lot of time playing basketball, swim, randomly work out, travel, eat a lot, drink some and sleep a lot.
